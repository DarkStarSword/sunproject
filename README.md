The Sun Project Interactive
===========================

The goal of Sun Project Interactive is able to very quickly generate images
that look vaguely similar to Space imagery that comes out of NASA. At present
the project is able to generate nebula like images, simple star-fields and
suns.

This was a project I created many years ago in high school. I haven't really
touched the code since then, but still use the program on a regular basis to
create the backgrounds for many of my sites & profiles. I never got around to
porting it to Linux, but it runs just fine under wine.

You can see some of the more unusual examples of what can be created using this
program here:

	<UL>
	A description of each item follows:
	<LI>Hide - This will hide the background panel.
	<LI>Solid Colour - This will bring up the windows dialog allowing you to select a colour. If you choose to draw under the image, a technique known as underlaying will be applied to place the colour behind the image. If you choose to draw over the image, the image will be merged with that colour 50%. If you select no to both, the image will be replaced by that colour.
	<LI>Nebula - This will open up the nebula panel explained below.
	<LI>Star-Field - This will draw a random star field behind the current image. This currently cannot be customised.

	<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=85%><TR><TD>
		Click on "Nebula" on the background panel to display the nebula panel:
	</TD><TD>
		<IMG SRC="images/screenshots/popnebula.png">
	</TD></TR></TABLE>
	The easiest way to create a nebula using this panel is to click on "Random" then "Draw". If you want to stop the drawing process before it is finished, you can click on "Abort". The parameters can be altered manually in "Advanced", if you wish to have more control, though most of the options there are hard to understand, and will be explained in a later article.<BR>
	Clicking on the "Gradient" button will bring up the gradient dialog box where you are able to generate gradients to use with the nebula. These will be automatically generated by simply clicking on "Random", and may or may not be enabled. Gradient nebulas will be explained in more detail later.<BR>
	Finally, clicking on the "Animation" button will bring up the animation dialog. Animation is currently only available in the nebula engine. In a future release, animation will be integrated into most of the program, allowing almost everything to be animated. The animation settings will be explained in more detail later.<BR>
	The following images were created just using "Random" and "Draw":
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula1.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula2.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula3.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula4.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula5.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula6.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula7.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula8.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula9.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Nebula10.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
  As you can see, with a little patience and persistence, some very different and beautiful (and some not so very beautiful) images can be created easily. Also, if you payed attention to those 10 images, you may have noticed that the last 5 seemed to have lines in them which were not evident in the first 5. They are the gradient nebulas mentioned above and will be explained later. Finally, you may have noticed that some of them already have a star-field. To do that, simply click on "Star-Field". Simple, isn't it?<BR>
  Another neat feature of the nebula engine is the ability to create seamless tileable images. If you look at the background of this web page you will notice that the blue nebula pattern repeats endlessly an yet there is no evident seam. This setting and a whole lot more are under Advanced.

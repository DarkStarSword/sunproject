	A description of each item follows:
	<LI>Hide - This will hide the star panel.
	<LI>Basics - This will display the star basics panel. Always start here!
	<LI>Surface - This will display the star surface panel to give the star a 3D look.
	<LI>Flares - This will display the flares panel to give the star solar flares!
	<LI>Clear Star - This will erase any star being prepared - USE WITH CAUTION!
	<LI>Finish Star! - Once you are happy with the look of the star, click this button ONCE to finalise it.

	<A NAME="Basics"></A>
	<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>Star Basics</P></H2>
	<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=85%><TR><TD>
		Click on "Basics" on the star panel to display the star basics panel:
	</TD><TD>
		<IMG SRC="images/screenshots/popstarbasics.png">
	</TD></TR></TABLE>
	<UL>
	<LI>To place the star, click on "Place Star". Two circles will appear in the preview area. The inner one represents the star radius, and the outer one represents the edge of the corona. To place the star, simply click where you want the star in the preview area. If you want the star centre to be out of the visible section, hold the left mouse button in the visible section, and drag to where you want the centre. If you wish to abort repositioning, simply click on "Place Star" again. The star can be repositioned at any time without having to redraw it.
	<LI>To change the size of the star, click on "Star Size". The preview circles will appear. Move the mouse over the preview area to select the desired size, and click. Again, the mouse can be dragged off the preview area to set the size larger than the viewable area. To abort Resizing, just click on "Star Size" again. If the star size is changed, the star must be redrawn.
	<LI>To change the size of the corona, click on "Corona Size". The preview circles will appear. Move the mouse over the preview area to select the desired size, and click. Again, the mouse can be dragged off the preview area to set the size larger than the viewable area. To abort Resizing, just click on "Corona Size" again. If the corona size is changed, the star must be redrawn.
	<LI>To change the 'base' colour of the star, simply click on "Star Colour" and choose the colour. After changing the star colour, you should redraw the star.
	<LI>"Export Star" allows you to save the star by itself in a 32-BPP bitmap with an alpha channel (for transparency) that can be imported into other applications.
	<LI>If you simply cannot decide on what you want, try clicking on "Random" and "Draw" until you get something that looks good.
	</UL>
	
	<A NAME="Surface"></A>
	<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>Star Surface</P></H2>
	<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=85%><TR><TD>
		Click on "Surface" on the star panel to display the star surface panel:
	</TD><TD>
		<IMG SRC="images/screenshots/popstarsurface.png">
	</TD></TR></TABLE>
	<UL>
	<LI>The amount of variance on the star surface can be adjusted by dragging the scroll bar left (for less variance) or right (for more variance). Clicking on "Random" will select a random variance.
	<LI>The little area on the left with the three colours shows the maximum variance with the current variance setting. The left colour is the darkest colour that could possibly be generated, the middle colour is the current star base colour, and the right colour is the brightest colour that could possibly be generated. Note that due to the smoothing, the colours will rarely be as dark or light as these show.
	<LI>To draw a surface on the star, click "Draw".
	<LI>The "Unlock" button is used to make the other controls active, even if the star hasn't been drawn yet. You should always draw the star first, so you should never have to click on this button.
	</UL>

	<A NAME="Flares"></A>
	<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>Solar Flares</P></H2>
	<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=85%><TR><TD>
		Click on "Flares" on the star panel to display the solar flares panel:
	</TD><TD>
		<IMG SRC="images/screenshots/popstarflares.png">
	</TD></TR></TABLE>
	<UL>
	<LI>The easiest way to draw solar flares in the stars corona using this panel is to click on "Random" then "Draw". If you want to stop the drawing process before it is finished, you can click on "Abort". Repeat this process until the flares look like what you want. The parameters can be altered manually in "Advanced", if you wish to have more control, though most of the options there are hard to understand, and will be explained in a later article. Note that flares like nebulas can take a while to draw, but unlike nebulas, are not previewed while they are being drawn.
	<LI>Clicking on the "Gradient" button will bring up the gradient dialog box where you are able to generate gradients to use with the flares. These will be automatically generated by simply clicking on "Random", and may or may not be enabled. Gradient flares will be explained in more detail later.

	<LI>The "Unlock" button is used to make the other controls active, even if the star hasn't been drawn yet. You should always draw the star first, so you should never have to click on this button.

	Gradients can sometimes make flares look better.</P>

	Dark nebula backgrounds can be great for that extra effect.</P>

	Using a nebula of similar colours can add to the effect,<BR>and the corona interacts better with them too.</P>

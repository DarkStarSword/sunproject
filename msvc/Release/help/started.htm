	First, start by opening The Sun Project Interactive. If you are asked about changing the resolution, it is highly recommended that you select 'yes'. If you do not, the program will not be able to show many colours. If you don't see this, don't worry - it just means that your system is already displaying true-colour.<BR>
	When the program opens, you should see something like this:<BR>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/screenshots/mainwindow.png"></P>
	<UL>
	<LI>The area to the lower right is called the preview area, and it will show the current image stretched into that tiny space.<BR>
	<LI>The "View Image" button will open up another window showing the image at its actual size. Left click and drag in the window to move the image, right click in the window to toggle stretching.<BR>
	<LI>Clicking on certain buttons such as "Star" will display more options, which can be used to manipulate the image.<BR>
	<LI>For a short description of each item, hold the mouse cursor over each item for a few seconds and a tool tip will appear.<BR>
	</UL>
	Have a quick look at some of the capabilities by clicking on "Random" (If you want it to stop drawing, just click on "Abort").<BR>
	Here are a few images that were created using only this method:<BR>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Image1.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Image2.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMAGE SRC="images/Random Image3.jpg" CLASS="Double"></P>
	If you keep trying random, you will notice that it sometimes draws a nebula behind the star, and sometimes draws multiple stars (up to 5). This method is perfect if you are not sure exactly what you want, but if you have a good idea, it can get tedious waiting for this method to even get close. And what if you want a nebula - sure, this method generates them occasionally, but it can take a lot of clicks.
